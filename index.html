                     We live in complete darkness when we walk this world without purpose. At times, it feels as if one could start a new life—different, with hope to make it better than the past. 
                 <br><br>
                 I arrived in Ravenport City after finishing my escape from reality through college. But inevitably, reality caught up with me. My latest escape was to return to the city where I had once lived with my aunt.
                 When I walked into the station, my aunt was waiting for me, and beside her stood a creepy, gloomy, dark, gothic man. I approached, hoping he wasn’t my aunt’s boyfriend—or worse, her child.
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"Amanda, you're here!!"</b> my aunt exclaimed cheerfully, still beautiful and in her prime.
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"I’ve made it,"</b> I said, hugging her. I felt happy—safe and at home. Until I saw him. The gloomy man behind her smiled at me in a haunting, disgusting way.
                 <br><br><p id ="change-color black">
                 <b>"Oh, I almost forgot,"</b> my aunt said, stopping our hug and stepping beside him. <b>"This is your cousin—Zeke. And Zeke, this is Amanda Sioux. I’m guessing she’s your big sister."</b>
                 <br><br>
                 Zeke stepped closer. It felt as though he was covered in darkness. Shaking his hand, I realized it was unnaturally cold for a living person.

              <div id ="storypage2">
                     <p id ="change-color black"><b>"Hey, Zeke,"</b> I said, forcing a smile.
                 <br><br>
                     <b>"Hi,"</b> he replied in a plain, cold voice. What unsettled me the most was how long he kept staring into my eyes—it felt as if he was looking through me. Terrifying.
                      Both Lucien and Zeke helped me with my bags as we left the station. The thought of taking a cab home filled me with anxiety—the silence, the awkwardness of sitting next to that weirdo. My thoughts suffocated me until he spoke.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>"Don't worry, I have a car," </b>Zeke said.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>"You have a car, Zeke? Don’t tell me you borrowed Davien’s car again," </b>my aunt said, concerned about his tendency to borrow people’s vehicles.
                     <br><br>
                     </p>
                         <p id ="page-1-storyline">

                     <b>"I wanted to spare my cousin the awkward silence of a cab,"</b>Zeke said, smiling at me.
                     <br><br>
                     I pretended to be okay with the situation, but it was far more awkward than a cab ride. They behaved as if nothing were wrong—it felt like I had walked into a lion’s den, or worse.
                     Zeke drove us home in Davien’s car, while my aunt played music to break the tension.
                     I had longed for a job for years in college, hoping to achieve a life of independence. I believed this was where I could start anew—a life worth living.
                     <br><br>Ravenport City—the city of never-ending mysteries and unknown terrors lurking in its dark beauty. A place many crawl to when they want to become something… and a place where many become piles of corpses in the cemetery. But who knows what it holds for an individual who craves unsettling desires?
                 
                 <b>"Zeke, did you go to Morris’s house to check if he’s all right?"</b>my aunt asked him, trying to soften the heaviness in her tone.
                  </p>

                 <p id ="page-1-storyline">
                     I tried to ignore their conversation, but there was nothing entertaining on my phone—only a more disturbing Facebook profile picture of Zeke. 
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"Yes, Aunt. I did. It was a disturbing scene. They thought Morris’s father committed suicide...."</b> Zeke said, expressionless.
                <br><br>
                Lucien interrupted before Zeke could continue,<b>"Isn’t it suicide? He hung himself, for God’s sake."</b>
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"No, no. God’s sake, no. He was killed—air bubbles injected into his neck. Probably by someone skilled at murder,"</b> Zeke said casually, his excitement hidden behind that cold expression.
                  <br><br>
                  The conversation between them was strange, but my aunt seemed unconcerned. I, however, was. There was something off about Zeke. In that moment, I caught his real smile—the one of excitement when he spoke about Morris’s father’s death.
                  We arrived home on EzMarch Street. It was already dark, yet the streets were crowded—Friday night, the city’s party day. Zeke noticed my annoyance as we stepped out of the car, the noise and revelry outside only amplifying it. My aunt helped me with my bags.
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"Aunt, I’m taking the car back to Davien. I’ll be back,"</b> Zeke said, still lingering inside.
                 <br><br>
                 <b>"It’s dark. You can take it back tomorrow morning," </b>she replied, entering the house with me following
                 <br><br>
                <b> "Tomorrow… tomm… mo… rrow," </b>Zeke muttered as he exited and locked the car, then stood watching the people outside—drinking, laughing, enjoying life.
                 <b>"… such a lovely time,"</b> he murmured, observing two lovers walking by..<b>"and a good ass"</b>

                     Zeke entered the house following behind Amanda and went to his room.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>"You can feel at home, I’m sure you’re tired…"</b> said Lucien as she was walking to the kitchen.
                     <br><br>
                     The house was still the same as she had left it, not a chair moved, not a tablecloth replaced. 
                     No new furniture, no additions that would make the space feel like someone else’s hand had touched it.
                     Amanda thought to herself — <b>"my aunt must love this place exactly the way it is".</b> She takes care
                     of it the way someone takes care of an heirloom, polishing the same wood, sweeping the same floors,
                     repeating the same rituals.</p>
                     <p id ="change-color black">
                     To anyone else it might seem like a small, plain house. But to Amanda, the rooms held 
                     their own weight. Every curtain, every lamp, every creak of the floorboards had memory 
                     attached. It was almost strange how such a simple house could give the feeling of a castle.
                     A castle not in size, but in presence — one that stood tall not with towers, but with history and 
                     stillness that commanded the air inside it.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>"Amanda…"</b> said Lucien, catching her niece in thought. She called her again,<b> “Amanda.”</b>
<b>“Yes!”</b> said Amanda.
<b>“I don’t think we have anything to eat,”</b> said Lucien, sounding half-apologetic, half-distracted.
                 </p>

                     Zeke appeared from his room. At first glance, he seemed ordinary — but Amanda couldn’t shake the feeling that something about his presence never fit the room, as if the air shifted when he entered.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>*Whenever I look at her, I feel like biting her nose off,*</b> Zeke thought as he walked past Amanda, who quickly pretended she hadn’t been looking at him.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>“What’s up?”</b> said Zeke to his aunt, noticing her stressed stare at the empty fridge.
                     <b>“We got nothing to eat. Could you go buy some food at the mall?”</b> Lucien muttered, rummaging absentmindedly.
                     <b>“You left your purse on the couch, next to Amanda,”</b> Zeke reminded her.
                     <br><br><b>“Amanda, could you bring my purse?”</b> said Lucien.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>“Oh no, there’s no need. I’ve already ordered a pizza,”</b> said Zeke.
                     <b>“Oh, thanks Zeke. I don’t know what I’d have done… I’ve been so busy, I keep forgetting about everything lately,”</b> said Lucien.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>*And I’m busy counting how much hair falls off my head every hour,*</b> Zeke whispered in his mind, smirking inwardly.
                     <b>“I think it’s better if you go sit down, rest, and watch TV with….... Amanda,”</b> said Zeke, wrapping an arm around her shoulder briefly, 
                     giving her a little hug.
                     <br><br>
                     The relationship between my aunt and Zeke seemed normal enough. But what bothered me was — <b>*when did he order the pizza?*</b>
                     <br><br>
                     Lucien sat beside Amanda on the couch, the television flickering in the dark. But Amanda wasn’t watching. She was suffocating 
                     in her thoughts, about the strangeness in this house, about the evil spirit she swore lived here, hidden.
                     <br><br>
                     The pizza Zeke had ordered arrived earlier than expected.
                     <br><br>
                     From then on we ate, and I filled their little stomachs with nutritionally dense, macromolecule-rich comestibles instead of just food.
                     <br><br>
                     When everyone went to their rooms, I was the only one left in the sitting room. I prefer sitting in the dark — the peace it gives me, and the thrill of uncertainty that might occur in such a dark room.
                     Her actions were coincidence, or perhaps a planned event. She sat with her phone, enjoying the silence. The peace and tranquility wrapped her, made her forget the outside world. Until something fell from Zeke’s room.
                     <br><br>
                     At first it seemed normal, but then his door opened. With the help of the darkness, Amanda blended in with the room, becoming invisible.

                     His shadow moved in the shadow of darkness — who knew it was possible for a shadow to be darker than the dark itself? She saw him pass the couches, carrying a bag, a cap pulled low, his hoodie shadowing his face.
                     I didn’t know what kind of guy he was, but I already had an idea.
                     
                     <br><br>Zeke left the house.</br><br>
                     Amanda’s curiosity wasn’t something she could suppress. Something about Zeke threatened to ruin her life, and so without hesitation, without fear of consequence, she followed him.
                     <br><br>
                     The streets were quiet. Peaceful. The lamps lit the roads of Ravenport with a cold glow. Their light stretched long, yellow halos on the wet pavement, making the sidewalks look like rivers of molten glass. Every shuttered shop was a closed mouth, every building window a blind eye.
                     <br><br>
                     The city at 3 a.m. was beautiful in its emptiness. You could hear your own thoughts bounce back at you. Amanda thought of how the silence itself seemed alive. Dogs barked at ghosts passing by. The moan of the wind carried like a chant across empty alleys.
                     <br><br>
                     Amanda kept to the left side of the pavement, Zeke walking on the right. He turned a corner, which forced Amanda to cross — but a car roared by, lights blazing, so fast she stumbled back in fright. Her heart rattled against her ribs, but she couldn’t give up.
                     <br><br>
                     When she finally reached the corner, he was gone.
                     <br><br>
                     But she didn’t stop. She kept walking, every step into the unknown. Her phone read 3 a.m., but time no longer mattered. The city lights guided her forward, their glow like silent guardians leading her deeper into the streets.
                     <br><br>
                     Silion Park was darker than the city — a kind of darkness that seemed to have weight. Trees bent low, their branches tangled like claws reaching for the path. The grass was wet and heavy, shining black under the faint lamps at the park’s edges. Darkness pooled thick between the benches and paths, like pockets of another world.
                     <br><br>
                     Amanda stopped at the park’s entrance. The silence here was different from the street’s silence. It wasn’t empty — it was crowded. Crowded with sounds that didn’t belong anywhere.
                     <br><br>
                     She thought she saw figures between the trees — silhouettes leaning just behind the trunks, slipping out of sight when she blinked. Once, she could have sworn she saw a hand curling back into the dark.
                     <br><br>

                     Whispers drifted through the branches, soft and circling, like a language she almost recognized but couldn’t. Sometimes they seemed to be behind her, sometimes ahead. Her skin crawled with the sense of being watched. Her heart beat so hard it felt like it was trying to escape her chest.
                     <br><br>
                     She strained her eyes, scanning every shadow. Every flicker of movement felt like a warning. And then — she saw him.
                     <br><br>
                     A figure bent over a hole in the ground. A shovel, dirt spraying. The rhythm of digging.
                     <br><br></p>
                     <p id ="underline">It was Zeke.</p>

                     <br><br>
                     Amanda froze. <b>*He’s digging a grave,*</b>she thought. <b>*He must have killed someone. What else would bring him here, at night, with a shovel?*</b>
                     <br><br>
                     She squinted, trying to see more — but the darkness made everything uncertain. Was it really a grave? Was it even Zeke? The whispers grew louder, echoing inside her own head.
                     <br><br>
                     Before she could think more, the figure looked up. His face shadowed, his eyes catching hers — or maybe she only imagined that, too.
                     Fear flooded her. She ran.
                     <br><br>
                     The city became a blur of sound and shadow. Her own footsteps multiplied, echoing as if an entire crowd was chasing her. Every shadow seemed to lunge forward. Every whisper of wind became a voice at her back. Her heart was ready to break her ribs and run along with her or maybe even faster than her.
